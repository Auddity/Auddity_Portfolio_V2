Early on in an interview I was asked what my weakest aspect in CSS was.  I answered it was animations.

Later on in the interview it was made clear they wanted someone with better transition and animation experience.

So I built this new portfolio site to work on adding transitions and animations.

It's also built with ReactJS, since I'm currently learning to use it.

## Built Using React
- Utilized React Router

- Applied Framer-Motion
  - Put in some basic transition effects

  - TODO: Play around with it more and see what may work better.

Early on in an interview I was asked what my weakest aspect in CSS was.  I answered it was animations.

Later on in the interview it was made clear they wanted someone with better transition and animation experience.

So I built this new portfolio site to work on adding transitions and animations.

It's also built with ReactJS, since I'm currently learning to use it.

## Built Using React
- Utilized React Router

- Utilizing Framer-Motion
  - Scale and opacity transition effects on components
  - Footer and Nav Link Bounce Animation

- More emphasis on using mixins for repeated css across components

## Next Steps
Priority:
  - Create Sass function for animations that are reused?

  - Make logo image it's own component, will be always visible (no transition) except on specific pages.

Secondary:
  - Header Links gradient effect on tech logos.

  - Apply Footer visible state site wide to accomodate elements it overlaps.

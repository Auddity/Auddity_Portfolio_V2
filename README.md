# New Portfolio Site

[LiveSite](https://audditydev.netlify.app/)

Early on in an interview I was asked what my weakest aspect in CSS was.  I answered it was animations.

Later on in the interview it was made clear they wanted someone with better transition and animation experience.

So I built this new portfolio site to work on adding transitions and animations.

It's also built with ReactJS, since I'm currently learning to use it.

## Built Using React
- Utilized React Router

- Currently Learning `react-transition-group` to apply transitions on components.

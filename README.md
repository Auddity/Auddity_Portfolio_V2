Early on in an interview I was asked what my weakest aspect in CSS was.  I answered it was animations.

Later on in the interview it was made clear they wanted someone with better transition and animation experience.

So I built this new portfolio site to work on adding transitions and animations.

It's also built with ReactJS, since I'm currently learning to use it.

## Built Using React
- Utilized React Router

- Utilizing Framer-Motion
  - Scale and opacity transition effects on components

  - Footer and Nav Link Bounce Animation

## Next Steps
Priority:
  - Decide Font.  Use [fontjoy](https://fontjoy.com/)

  - Add Note to click portfolio item image to go to live site when vewing on mobile.

Secondary:
  - Add color animation to Nav links on hover

  - Make Links on contact/success more clear that they're links
    - animated color
